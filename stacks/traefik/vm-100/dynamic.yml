  # Routers define how requests are matched and routed
  routers:
    # Emby - Media streaming server (CRITICAL)
    # Note: Emby uses host network mode, so we route to host.docker.internal
    emby:
      rule: "Host(`emby.local.infinity-node.com`)"
      entryPoints:
        - web
      service: emby

    # Portainer - Container management

      rule: "Host(`portainer-100.local.infinity-node.com`)"
      entryPoints:
        - web
      service: portainer-100

  # Services define the backend servers to route to
  services:
    # Emby - Internal port 8096 (host network mode)
    # Use Docker bridge gateway IP to reach services on host network from bridge network
    # On Linux, host.docker.internal may not work, so use 172.17.0.1 (default bridge gateway)

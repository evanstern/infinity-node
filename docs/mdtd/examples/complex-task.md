# Example: Complex Task - Migrate Emby to New Storage Backend

This example demonstrates a complex task walkthrough.

## Task Context

**Scenario**: Migrate Emby from current NAS to new storage system
**Complexity**: Complex
**Estimated time**: 12-16 hours over 2 weeks
**Priority**: High (2)

---

## Phase 1: Understanding & Classification

### Problem Statement

**What**: Current NFS storage approaching capacity. Need to migrate Emby to new 100TB storage backend before running out of space.

**Why now**:
- Current storage 85% full
- New storage system available
- Must migrate before capacity issues
- Opportunity to improve performance

**Who benefits**:
- Household (more storage for media)
- System (better performance, more headroom)
- Operations (modern storage management)

### Classification

- **Category**: infrastructure (storage migration affecting critical service)
- **Priority**: 2 (high - critical service, approaching capacity limit)
- **Complexity**: complex
  - **High risk**: Affects critical service (Emby - VM 100)
  - **Multiple approaches**: Several migration strategies possible
  - **Significant scope**: 15TB data transfer, service reconfiguration
  - **Phased required**: Cannot do big-bang migration
  - **Extended timeline**: 12-16 hours over 2 weeks

---

## Phase 2: Solution Design

### Approaches Considered

**Approach 1: Offline migration (rsync during downtime)**
- ‚úÖ Simplest approach
- ‚úÖ Guarantees consistency
- ‚ùå Requires extended downtime (8-12 hours)
- ‚ùå Household impact unacceptable

**Approach 2: Live migration with parallel run**
- ‚úÖ No downtime
- ‚úÖ Fallback available during transition
- ‚úÖ Can validate new storage before cutover
- ‚ùå Complex synchronization
- ‚ùå Double resource usage temporarily
- ‚ùå More moving parts

**Approach 3: Incremental migration by library**
- ‚úÖ Phased approach reduces risk
- ‚úÖ Can validate each library before next
- ‚úÖ Limited household impact (one library at a time)
- ‚úÖ Can rollback individual libraries
- ‚ùå Takes longer overall (2 weeks)
- ‚ùå Temporary split configuration

**Approach 4: Snapshot and restore**
- ‚úÖ Fast cutover
- ‚úÖ Consistent point-in-time
- ‚ùå Requires VM downtime
- ‚ùå Complex with NFS backend
- ‚ùå Not applicable to current setup

### Recommendation: Approach 3 (Incremental by Library)

**Detailed rationale**:

**Critical service considerations**:
- Emby is household's primary media access
- 99.9% uptime target cannot accept 8-12 hour outage
- Users access daily - must minimize impact
- Risk mitigation is paramount

**Incremental approach benefits**:
1. **Phased validation**: Test new storage with non-critical library first (e.g., Documentaries)
2. **Limited blast radius**: If issues found, only one library affected
3. **Learning curve**: Early libraries inform process for later ones
4. **Rollback per library**: Can revert individual libraries if needed
5. **Household coordination**: Can schedule library migrations during low-usage times

**Migration sequence**:
1. Week 1: Documentaries (low usage, 500GB) - **test case**
2. Week 1: Home Videos (low usage, 200GB) - **validation**
3. Week 2: TV Shows (high usage, 6TB) - **phased over 3-4 nights**
4. Week 2: Movies (high usage, 8TB) - **phased over 4-5 nights**

**Timing**: All migrations during 3-6 AM window when usage lowest

## Phase 3: Risk Assessment

### Risks Identified

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: Data corruption during transfer**
- **Impact**: Critical - could lose media files
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use rsync with checksum verification
  - Test restore before switching Emby
  - Keep source data until fully validated
  - Have backup of Emby configuration

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: Performance degradation on new storage**
- **Impact**: High - poor user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Benchmark new storage before migration
  - Test with small library first
  - Monitor performance during migration
  - Have rollback plan ready

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Extended migration window (users notice)**
- **Impact**: Medium - household inconvenience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Migrate during 3-6 AM windows
  - Start with low-usage libraries
  - Communicate timeline to household
  - Keep old storage available during transition

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 4: Configuration errors break Emby**
- **Impact**: Critical - service outage
- **Mitigation**:
  - Backup Emby config before changes
  - Test configuration changes before applying
  - Have rollback script ready
  - Test on non-critical library first

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 5: Network saturation during transfer**
- **Impact**: Medium - slows other services
- **Mitigation**:
  - Throttle rsync transfer rate
  - Schedule during low-usage windows
  - Monitor network utilization

‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 6: Discovery of additional complexity**
- **Impact**: Medium - timeline extension
- **Mitigation**:
  - Phase 0 discovery identifies unknowns
  - Buffer in timeline (2 weeks for 1 week of work)
  - Ready to adapt plan based on findings

### Critical Service Requirements

**Backup Plan**:
- Full backup of Emby `/config` volume
- Snapshot of VM 100 before starting
- Source data remains on old storage until validated
- Backup stored: `/mnt/nas-backup/emby-migration-YYYY-MM-DD/`

**Rollback Procedure**:
1. Stop Emby container
2. Revert library path to old storage in Emby config
3. Restart Emby container
4. Verify library accessible
5. **Estimated rollback time: 5 minutes per library**

**Timing**:
- All migrations: 3-6 AM (low usage)
- Coordinate with household: "Library X will be unavailable 3-6 AM on DATE"
- Weekend mornings preferred

**Extended Validation**:
- 48-hour monitoring after each library migration
- User acceptance testing (household plays content)
- Performance comparison vs baseline
- Before migrating next library

## Phase 4: Scope Definition

### In Scope
‚úÖ Migrate all Emby media libraries to new storage
‚úÖ Update Emby configuration for new paths

# Task: IN-028 - Test and Iterate Cursor Configuration

> **Quick Summary**: Systematically test Cursor 2.0 configuration with real workflows, identify pain points, and iterate based on findings

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
After implementing Cursor configuration (IN-024, IN-025, IN-026, IN-027), we need real-world validation. Does `.cursorrules` provide effective AI guidance? Are slash commands working? Is documentation helpful? We need to identify gaps and iterate.

**Why now?**
- Configuration is implemented but untested in real workflows
- Better to find issues early through deliberate testing
- Want to refine while changes are fresh in mind
- Establishes baseline for future improvements

**Who benefits?**
- **User**: Improved Cursor experience based on actual usage
- **AI**: Better configuration based on real interaction patterns
- **Project**: Validated, iterated tooling that actually works well

## Solution Design

### Recommended Approach

**Two-phase approach: Test ‚Üí Iterate ‚Üí Validate**

**Week 1: Systematic Testing**
- Use Cursor for regular project work
- Deliberately test each feature and configuration element
- Document friction points and observations
- Collect data on what works and what doesn't

**Week 2: Iteration**
- Review findings from Week 1
- Prioritize improvements (critical ‚Üí nice-to-have)
- Implement fixes and enhancements
- Re-test problem areas
- Validate improvements work

**Ongoing: Continuous improvement**
- Update docs as patterns emerge
- Add examples of effective usage
- Refine configuration based on learnings

**Rationale**: Real-world testing reveals issues that design can't predict. Structured approach ensures we systematically validate all aspects while staying practical. Two-week window provides enough data without dragging on forever.

### Scope Definition

**‚úÖ In Scope:**
- Test `.cursorrules` effectiveness with real queries
- Test slash commands (`/task`, `/commit`, `/create-task`)
- Test Cursor features (Composer, Chat, @syntax, inline edit)
- Test documentation accuracy (CURSOR.md, CODEBASE.md)
- Validate `.cursorignore` improves performance
- Document friction points and issues
- Prioritize and implement improvements
- Re-test after changes
- Document lessons learned

**‚ùå Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Testing with other AI models (focus on Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- Major rewrites of configuration (refinement only)
- Adding significant new features (note for future tasks)
- Performance benchmarking (subjective assessment is fine)

**üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable)**: 
All configuration elements tested, critical issues fixed, lessons documented

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Pitfalls

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: Testing reveals fundamental design flaws** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Flexible approach, willing to make significant changes if needed. Document what doesn't work and why.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: Bias toward confirmation (only looking for success)** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Actively look for problems. Ask "what's not working?" rather than "does it work?"

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Testing drags on indefinitely** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Set 2-week timebox. Make decisions even with incomplete data. Can always iterate more later.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 4: Findings are too subjective** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Document specific examples, track metrics where possible (AI references docs, asks for approval, etc.)

### Dependencies

- [ ] **IN-024: Cursor core configuration** - Must be completed (blocking: yes)
- [ ] **IN-025: Cursor documentation** - Should be completed for full testing (blocking: yes)
- [ ] **IN-026: Slash commands** - Helpful but not blocking (blocking: no)
- [ ] **IN-027: AI-agnostic docs** - Helpful but not blocking (blocking: no)

### Critical Service Impact

**Services Affected**: None - Testing and documentation work only

### Rollback Plan

**Applicable for**: Configuration and documentation changes

**How to rollback if this goes wrong:**
1. Revert any configuration changes made during iteration
2. Restore documentation from git if needed
3. No service impact, safe to experiment

**Recovery time estimate**: < 5 minutes

## Execution Plan

### Phase 0: Preparation

**Primary Agent**: `testing`

- [ ] **Verify all prerequisites complete** `[agent:testing]` `[depends:IN-024,IN-025]`
  - IN-024 completed (.cursorrules, .cursorignore exist)
  - IN-025 completed (docs/CURSOR.md, docs/CODEBASE.md exist)
  - Baseline configuration is in place

### Phase 1: Week 1 - Systematic Testing

**Primary Agent**: `testing`

- [ ] **Test .cursorrules effectiveness** `[agent:testing]`
  - Start new Cursor chat: Ask "What is the project structure?"
  - Verify AI references docs correctly
  - Ask "What are critical services?" - verify safety mentions
  - Ask about agent system - verify AI understands
  - Ask AI to make change - verify asks for approval
  - Document observations

- [ ] **Test slash commands** `[agent:testing]`
  - Use `/task IN-XXX` for a real task - verify workflow
  - Use `/commit` for changes - verify quality checks
  - Use `/create-task` - verify task creation flow
  - Note any friction or confusion

- [ ] **Test Cursor features** `[agent:testing]`
  - Use Composer for substantial work
  - Use Chat for quick questions
  - Test @ syntax: `@docs/CLAUDE.md`, `@stacks`
  - Test `@codebase` - verify useful context
  - Use inline edit (Cmd+K) for quick changes
  - Document what works well vs what doesn't

- [ ] **Test documentation** `[agent:testing]`
  - Follow docs/CURSOR.md instructions
  - Test @ syntax examples from docs
  - Verify examples are accurate
  - Note any unclear or missing sections

- [ ] **Test performance** `[agent:testing]`
  - Verify `.cursorignore` excludes expected files
  - Check codebase search speed (subjective)
  - Confirm irrelevant files don't appear in searches

- [ ] **Document daily observations** `[agent:testing]`
  - Keep notes in this task's Work Log
  - Specific examples of friction
  - Things that work well
  - Ideas for improvement

### Phase 2: Week 2 - Iteration & Improvement

**Primary Agent**: `documentation` (making changes)

- [ ] **Review Week 1 findings** `[agent:documentation]` `[depends:phase-1]`
  - Compile list of issues from observations
  - Categorize: Critical / High / Medium / Low
  - Prioritize what to fix

- [ ] **Implement improvements** `[agent:documentation]` `[depends:phase-1]`
  - Fix critical issues first
  - Update `.cursorrules` if needed
  - Update documentation if unclear
  - Enhance examples if helpful
  - Add missing sections

- [ ] **Re-test problem areas** `[agent:testing]` `[depends:phase-1]`

  - Check for new problems introduced

- [ ] **Update based on learnings** `[agent:documentation]` `[depends:phase-1]`
  - Add discovered patterns to docs
  - Include examples of effective usage
  - Document what works well (preserve it!)

### Phase 3: Documentation & Wrap-up

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [ ] **Document lessons learned** `[agent:documentation]`
  - What worked well - keep doing
  - What didn't work - why and how fixed
  - Unexpected discoveries
  - Recommendations for future

- [ ] **Create follow-up tasks if needed** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Major improvements that need separate tasks
  - Future enhancements based on patterns
  - New commands or features to consider

- [ ] **Update configuration documentation** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Note any changes made during testing
  - Add tips based on experience
  - Include gotchas discovered

## Acceptance Criteria

**Done when all of these are true:**
- [ ] All configuration elements tested with real usage
- [ ] Slash commands tested and validated
- [ ] Cursor features tested (Composer, Chat, @syntax, inline edit)
- [ ] Documentation accuracy validated
- [ ] `.cursorignore` performance verified
- [ ] Issues documented with specific examples
- [ ] Improvements prioritized and implemented
- [ ] Critical issues fixed and re-tested
- [ ] Lessons learned documented comprehensively
- [ ] Follow-up tasks created if needed
- [ ] All changes committed with descriptive messages

## Testing Plan

**This IS the testing task!**

**Approach:**
- Use Cursor naturally for project work (don't force artificial tests)
- Deliberately test each feature/config element at least once
- Document observations immediately (don't rely on memory)
- Look actively for problems (not just confirming it works)
- Specific test scenarios embedded in execution plan

**Success Metrics (subjective but trackable):**
- Does AI reference docs appropriately? (yes/no + examples)
- Does AI follow safety guidelines unprompted? (yes/no + examples)
- Do slash commands save time vs manual? (yes/no + why)
- Is @ syntax intuitive and useful? (yes/no + what works/doesn't)
- Are there repeated friction points? (document patterns)

## Notes

**Priority Rationale**: 
Medium priority (3) - important validation work but not urgent. Should complete after initial configuration tasks but before considering it "done".

**Complexity Rationale**: 
Moderate - systematic testing requires discipline and attention, iteration requires judgment about what to fix. Ongoing nature (2 weeks) adds complexity.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Don't rush - two weeks allows proper testing without dragging on
- Be honest about what doesn't work - better to know than pretend
- Document specific examples - "AI didn't understand X" more useful than "sometimes confusing"
- Iterate boldly - configuration is meant to serve us, not the other way around

**Testing Philosophy**:
- Real-world usage > artificial tests
- Look for friction, not just success
- Subjective assessment is valid (this is our tool)
- Two weeks of actual use reveals more than hours of deliberate testing

**What Success Looks Like**:
- Cursor feels productive and helpful
- AI understands project without constant reminding
- Safety guidelines followed consistently
- Slash commands are natural to use
- Documentation is referenced when helpful
- No major surprises or frustrations

# Task: IN-025 - Add Cursor-Specific Documentation

> **Quick Summary**: Create user-facing documentation explaining Cursor 2.0 features and how to use them effectively with infinity-node project

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
With Cursor configuration in place (IN-024), users need documentation that explains how to actually use Cursor features effectively. While `.cursorrules` helps the AI, we need guides for the human user on Composer vs Chat, @ syntax, slash commands, and workspace optimization.

**Why now?**
- IN-024 provides AI context, but users need usage guides
- Switching from Claude Code to Cursor requires learning new patterns
- Documentation will improve productivity and avoid confusion

**Who benefits?**
- **User (Evan)**: Clear guidance on how to leverage Cursor effectively
- **Future collaborators**: Onboarding documentation for using this project in Cursor
- **AI assistant**: `docs/CODEBASE.md` provides quick reference via @codebase

## Solution Design

### Recommended Approach

Create three complementary documentation files:

**1. `docs/CURSOR.md`**: User-facing Cursor guide
- Overview of Cursor 2.0 features (Composer, Chat, inline edit)
- When to use which features
- Context management with @ syntax
- Slash command usage examples
- Best practices for work sessions
- Reference to configuration files

**2. `docs/CODEBASE.md`**: Quick reference for AI assistants
- Directory structure overview
- Common operations quick reference
- Key conventions
- Navigation tips (optimized for @codebase queries)

**3. `.vscode/settings.json`**: Workspace settings
- File associations (markdown, .cursorrules, .env.example)
- Files to exclude from explorer
- Search exclusions
- Markdown/YAML validation
- Editor settings for markdown files

**Rationale**: These three files cover different needs - user guide (CURSOR.md), AI reference (CODEBASE.md), and editor optimization (settings.json). Keep documentation focused and avoid duplication.

### Scope Definition

**‚úÖ In Scope:**
- Create docs/CURSOR.md with Cursor feature explanations
- Create docs/CODEBASE.md with project structure overview
- Create .vscode/settings.json with workspace settings
- Link new docs from docs/CLAUDE.md (or AI-COLLABORATION.md if renamed)
- Link from project README.md

**‚ùå Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Refactoring existing docs/CLAUDE.md (separate task: IN-027)
- Creating new slash commands (separate task: IN-026)
- Advanced Cursor features not immediately relevant
- Video tutorials or interactive guides

**üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable)**: 
All three files created with essential content, properly linked from existing documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Pitfalls

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: Documentation becomes outdated as Cursor updates** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Focus on core features that are stable, note version when relevant, mark experimental features clearly

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: .vscode/settings.json conflicts with user's personal settings** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Only include project-specific settings, use workspace-level settings that don't override user preferences

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Duplication between CLAUDE.md and CURSOR.md** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: CLAUDE.md for AI collaboration workflows, CURSOR.md for tool usage. Cross-reference instead of duplicating.

### Dependencies

- [ ] **IN-024: Cursor core configuration** - Should be completed first so we can reference .cursorrules (blocking: no, but recommended)
- [ ] **docs/CLAUDE.md exists** - For cross-referencing (blocking: no)

### Critical Service Impact

**Services Affected**: None - Documentation only, no service impact

### Rollback Plan

**Applicable for**: Documentation changes

**How to rollback if this goes wrong:**
1. Delete the new files (docs/CURSOR.md, docs/CODEBASE.md, .vscode/settings.json)
2. Remove links from README.md and docs/CLAUDE.md
3. Or restore from git: `git checkout HEAD -- docs/CURSOR.md docs/CODEBASE.md .vscode/settings.json`

**Recovery time estimate**: < 1 minute

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Create Documentation Files

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [ ] **Create docs/CURSOR.md** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Overview of Cursor 2.0 features
  - Composer vs Chat guidance (when to use each)
  - Context management with @ syntax
  - Slash command usage examples
  - Best practices for work sessions
  - Inline edit (Cmd+K) usage
  - Reference to configuration files (.cursorrules, .cursorignore)

- [ ] **Create docs/CODEBASE.md** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Directory structure overview
  - Common operations quick reference
  - Key conventions
  - Navigation tips for AI assistants

- [ ] **Create .vscode/settings.json** `[agent:documentation]`
  - File associations (markdown, .cursorrules, .env.example)
  - Files to exclude from explorer
  - Search exclusions
  - Markdown/YAML validation enabled
  - Editor settings for markdown files

- [ ] **Link from existing docs** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Add links from docs/CLAUDE.md (or AI-COLLABORATION.md)
  - Add link from README.md
  - Ensure cross-references are accurate

### Phase 2: Validation

**Primary Agent**: `testing`

- [ ] **Test all documentation links** `[agent:testing]`
  - Verify links work correctly
  - Check wiki-links in Obsidian
  - Verify markdown references

- [ ] **Test .vscode/settings.json** `[agent:testing]`
  - Verify JSON is valid
  - Check settings don't conflict with existing workspace config
  - Test that file associations work
  - Verify validation features work

- [ ] **Test @codebase with docs/CODEBASE.md** `[agent:testing]`
  - Ask AI "@codebase what's the project structure?"
  - Verify relevant context is returned
  - Check that overview is helpful

## Acceptance Criteria

**Done when all of these are true:**
- [ ] docs/CURSOR.md created with all sections
- [ ] docs/CODEBASE.md created with project overview
- [ ] .vscode/settings.json created and valid
- [ ] All documentation linked from docs/CLAUDE.md (or AI-COLLABORATION.md)
- [ ] Links added to README.md
- [ ] All links tested and working
- [ ] .vscode/settings.json tested and applies correctly
- [ ] Testing Agent validates (see testing plan below)
- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message

## Testing Plan

**[[docs/agents/TESTING|Testing Agent]] validates:**
- All markdown files have valid syntax
- .vscode/settings.json is valid JSON
- All links work correctly (no 404s)
- Settings don't conflict with workspace
- Content is accurate and helpful

**Manual validation:**
1. Follow CURSOR.md instructions in actual Cursor session
2. Test @ syntax examples work as documented
3. Test slash commands work as documented
4. Verify VSCode settings apply correctly
5. Ask AI "@codebase" and verify useful response

## Related Documentation

- [[docs/CLAUDE|Working with AI Assistants]]
- [[docs/agents/README|Agent System]]
- `.cursorrules` (created in IN-024)
- `.cursorignore` (created in IN-024)

## Notes

**Priority Rationale**: 
Medium priority (3) - useful documentation that improves user experience, but not blocking other work. Can be done anytime after IN-024.

**Complexity Rationale**: 
Simple - straightforward documentation task with clear deliverables and minimal unknowns.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on practical workflows and examples from this project
- Keep CURSOR.md action-oriented (how-to guide)
- Keep CODEBASE.md concise (quick reference only)
- Test settings.json thoroughly before committing

**Follow-up**:
- Iterate based on actual usage
- Add examples as we discover good patterns
- Keep docs up to date with Cursor updates

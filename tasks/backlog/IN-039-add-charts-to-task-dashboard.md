# Task: IN-039 - Add inline charts to Task Dashboard

> **Quick Summary**: Add DataviewJS-powered line chart to DASHBOARD.md showing task completion trends over time.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
The current Task Dashboard (`tasks/DASHBOARD.md`) displays task completion data in a table format showing completed tasks by month. While functional, a visual chart would make trends more immediately apparent and make the dashboard more engaging and informative at a glance.

**Why now?**
- User requested this specific enhancement
- Documentation resource provided showing how to implement (Dataview JS inline charts)
- Low effort, high visual impact improvement
- Complements existing table-based completion trend query

**Who benefits?**
- **Project maintainers**: Easier to spot completion velocity trends and patterns
- **AI agents**: Better understanding of project activity when reviewing dashboard
- **Future contributors**: More engaging way to understand project status

## Solution Design

### Recommended Approach

Add a DataviewJS code block to the Task Dashboard that:
1. Queries completed tasks from `tasks/completed/` folder
2. Groups tasks by month using the `updated` frontmatter field
3. Formats data for Chart.js (Obsidian's built-in charting library)
4. Renders as a line chart showing completion trend

**Key components:**
- DataviewJS query block using `dv.pages()` to access task data
- Data aggregation by month using date formatting
- Chart.js configuration for line chart
- Placement in dashboard below existing "Completion Trend" table

**Rationale**: DataviewJS provides access to the full JavaScript API and Chart.js integration. This allows us to create rich visualizations while still querying directly from task frontmatter data, maintaining single source of truth.

> [!abstract]- üîÄ Alternative Approaches Considered
>
> **Option A: Static chart via external tool**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Could use more sophisticated charting libraries
> - ‚ùå Cons: Not live-updating, requires manual regeneration
> - ‚ùå Cons: Breaks Obsidian-native workflow
> - **Decision**: Not chosen - loses live data benefit
>
> **Option B: DataviewJS with Chart.js (Recommended)**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Native Obsidian integration, live-updating
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Leverages existing task frontmatter data
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Well-documented approach
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Consistent with existing Dataview queries in dashboard
> - **Decision**: ‚úÖ CHOSEN - best fit for existing infrastructure
>
> **Option C: Inline DQL (not DataviewJS)**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Simpler syntax
> - ‚ùå Cons: Limited to basic visualizations, no Chart.js access
> - ‚ùå Cons: May not support line charts
> - **Decision**: Not chosen - insufficient charting capabilities

### Scope Definition

**‚úÖ In Scope:**
- Line chart showing completed tasks by month
- Chart placed in dashboard below existing completion trend table
- Use existing `updated` field from task frontmatter
- Basic chart styling (title, axis labels)
- Document chart implementation in dashboard comments

**‚ùå Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Additional chart types (pie, bar, area) - can be follow-up tasks
- Interactive features (click to filter, zoom, etc.)
- Multiple chart comparisons (by priority, by agent, etc.)
- Chart export functionality
- Custom color schemes or advanced styling

**üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable)**:
A working line chart that displays task completions by month, auto-updates when tasks are completed, and renders properly in Obsidian with Dataview plugin enabled.

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Pitfalls

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: Chart doesn't render** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Test in Obsidian with Dataview plugin enabled, verify Chart.js is available. Include fallback note if chart fails to load.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: Performance issues with large dataset** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Limit chart to last 12 months initially. Can expand if performance is acceptable.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Date parsing issues** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Use consistent date format from frontmatter (`YYYY-MM-DD`), test with various task completion dates.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 4: Breaks existing dashboard queries** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Add chart as new section, don't modify existing DQL queries. Test all dashboard sections after changes.

### Dependencies

**Prerequisites (must exist before starting):**
- [x] **Obsidian with Dataview plugin** - Required for DataviewJS execution (blocking: yes)
- [x] **Task frontmatter with date fields** - All tasks have `updated` field (blocking: yes)
- [x] **Completed tasks exist** - Need data to chart (blocking: no - can test with existing data)

**No blocking dependencies** - can start immediately. All prerequisites already met.

### Critical Service Impact

**Services Affected**: None

This is a pure documentation enhancement. No services, VMs, or containers are affected. The change only adds visual elements to a markdown file that's viewed in Obsidian.

### Rollback Plan

**Applicable for**: Documentation changes

**How to rollback if this goes wrong:**
1. Remove the DataviewJS code block from DASHBOARD.md
2. Restore original dashboard from git history if needed: `git checkout HEAD~1 tasks/DASHBOARD.md`
3. No service restarts or configuration changes needed

**Recovery time estimate**: < 1 minute

**Backup requirements:**
- Git history serves as backup (no explicit backup needed)
- Can test in separate markdown file before adding to dashboard

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Research & Setup

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [ ] **Study Dataview JS charting documentation** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Review provided URL: https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/queries/dql-js-inline/
  - Find Chart.js examples in Obsidian Dataview docs
  - Identify data structure needed for line charts

- [ ] **Analyze existing completion trend query** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Review current DQL query at lines 204-210 in DASHBOARD.md
  - Understand how it groups by month
  - Determine how to replicate logic in DataviewJS

### Phase 2: Implementation

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [ ] **Create DataviewJS chart code block** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Query completed tasks from `tasks/completed/`
  - Group by month using `dateformat(updated, "yyyy-MM")`
  - Count tasks per month
  - Format data for Chart.js

- [ ] **Configure Chart.js visualization** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Set chart type to 'line'
  - Configure axes (x: months, y: task count)
  - Add chart title: "Task Completion Trend"
  - Set reasonable defaults for styling

- [ ] **Add chart to dashboard** `[agent:documentation]`

  - Check for any performance degradation

### Phase 4: Documentation

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [ ] **Add implementation notes to dashboard** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Document DataviewJS approach in HTML comment
  - Note Chart.js dependency
  - Include reference to Dataview documentation

- [ ] **Update note at bottom of dashboard** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Ensure note mentions DataviewJS requirement
  - Keep existing note about Dataview plugin requirement

## Acceptance Criteria

**Done when all of these are true:**
- [ ] Line chart displays in DASHBOARD.md showing completed tasks by month
- [ ] Chart data matches the existing completion trend table
- [ ] Chart renders properly in Obsidian preview mode
- [ ] Chart updates automatically when new tasks are completed
- [ ] All existing dashboard queries still function correctly
- [ ] Implementation is documented in dashboard comments
- [ ] Chart includes proper title and axis labels
- [ ] All execution plan items completed
- [ ] Testing Agent validates (see testing plan below)
- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message (awaiting user approval)

## Testing Plan

**[[docs/agents/TESTING|Testing Agent]] validates:**
- Chart renders without errors in Obsidian
- Data accuracy: chart matches table data
- All existing dashboard Dataview queries still functional
- No console errors or warnings

**Manual validation:**
1. **Open dashboard in Obsidian preview** - Chart should display with line graph showing months on x-axis and task count on y-axis
2. **Compare chart to table** - Numbers should match between visual chart and completion trend table
3. **Complete a new task** - Mark a task complete, verify dashboard updates automatically and chart reflects new data
4. **Test in reading mode** - Switch between edit and reading modes, ensure chart displays in both

## Notes

**Priority Rationale**:
Priority 5 (low) because this is a visual enhancement, not a functional requirement. The dashboard already provides all necessary data in table format. This adds convenience and visual appeal but doesn't enable any new capabilities or fix any problems.

**Complexity Rationale**:
Simple because:
- Well-documented approach with examples available
- Single file modification (DASHBOARD.md)
- No dependencies on external services or complex systems
- Clear success criteria
- Low risk of breaking anything
- Straightforward implementation using existing patterns

**Implementation Notes**:
- Chart.js is built into Obsidian and available to DataviewJS automatically
- Existing completion trend table query (lines 204-210) provides exact logic to replicate
- Can test in separate file before adding to dashboard to avoid breaking existing setup
- Consider limiting to last 12 months for performance (can expand if needed)

**Follow-up Tasks**:
- Could add additional chart types (bar chart by priority, pie chart by agent)
- Could add interactive features if user finds basic chart valuable
- Could create charts for other dashboard sections (backlog trends, agent workload, etc.)

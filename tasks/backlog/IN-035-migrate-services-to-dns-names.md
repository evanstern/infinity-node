# Task: IN-035 - Migrate Services to DNS Names

> **Quick Summary**: Migrate remaining services from hardcoded IP addresses to DNS names (using Pi-hole local DNS), including Bitwarden CLI, docker-compose files, and automation scripts.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
After IN-034 establishes Pi-hole DNS infrastructure and validates it with audiobookshelf, we need to migrate the rest of the system to use DNS names instead of hardcoded IPs. Currently:

- Bitwarden CLI configured with hardcoded IP (http://192.168.86.249:8111)
- Docker compose files may reference other services via IP
- Automation scripts use hardcoded IPs
- Documentation references hardcoded IPs

**Why now?**
- IN-034 proved DNS works with audiobookshelf
- DNS infrastructure now stable and ready for broader use
- Better to migrate everything at once while context is fresh
- Reduces technical debt before it spreads further

**Who benefits?**
- **System administrator (Evan)**: Single place to update IPs when network changes
- **Automation scripts**: More reliable, less maintenance
- **Documentation**: Stays accurate even when IPs change

## Solution Design

### Recommended Approach

**Phased migration by risk level** - Start with non-critical services, validate each group, then migrate critical services last. This minimizes risk and provides rollback points.

**Key components:**
- **Bitwarden CLI**: Update server URL to use DNS name
- **Docker stacks**: Update compose files to reference services via DNS
- **Automation scripts**: Replace hardcoded IPs with DNS names
- **Documentation**: Update to reference DNS names instead of IPs

**Migration phases:**
1. **Low-risk services** (misc services on VM 103): Homepage, linkwarden, etc.
2. **Medium-risk services** (arr stack on VM 102): Radarr, Sonarr, Prowlarr, Lidarr
3. **Critical services** (Emby, downloads): Highest caution, backup before changes
4. **Infrastructure** (Bitwarden CLI, scripts): Update automation tooling

### Scope Definition

**‚úÖ In Scope:**
- Update Bitwarden CLI configuration to use `vaultwarden.local.infinity-node.com`
- Migrate all non-critical service stacks to DNS names (VM 103 services)
- Migrate arr services to DNS names (VM 102)
- Migrate critical services to DNS names (VM 100, 101) - with extra caution
- Update automation scripts in `scripts/` to use DNS names
- Update documentation to reference DNS names
- Test each service after migration
- Create rollback plan for each phase

**‚ùå Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Adding new DNS records (IN-034 created all needed records)
- Changing Pi-hole configuration (infrastructure already set up)
- Migrating services that don't use inter-service communication (if any)
- External access via Pangolin (still uses external domains)

**üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable)**:
All infinity-node services and automation use DNS names instead of IPs. When IPs change, only Pi-hole DNS records need updating.

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Pitfalls

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: Critical service disruption (Emby, downloads)** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Migrate critical services last, during low-usage window (3-6 AM), backup configs, test thoroughly, have rollback ready.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: Inter-service communication breaks** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Test each service's functionality after migration, not just accessibility. Verify services can talk to each other (e.g., Sonarr ‚Üí Prowlarr).

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Bitwarden CLI breaks, can't retrieve secrets** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Test CLI immediately after updating, have IP-based config backed up for quick rollback. Don't commit until validated.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 4: Typos in DNS names break services** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Use consistent naming pattern, copy/paste DNS names from Pi-hole or docs, test resolution before deploying.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 5: Automation scripts fail silently** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Test all scripts in `scripts/` directory after updating, verify they can resolve DNS and connect to services.

### Dependencies

**Prerequisites (must exist before starting):**
- [ ] **IN-034 completed** - Pi-hole DNS operational and tested (blocking: yes)
- [ ] **DNS records exist** - All services have entries in Pi-hole (blocking: yes)
- [ ] **Testing Agent ready** - Can validate each migration phase (blocking: no)

**Blocking dependency: IN-034** - Cannot proceed until DNS infrastructure is working.

### Critical Service Impact

**Services Affected**: ALL services, including critical ones

**Critical services:**
- **Emby (VM 100)**: Primary media streaming - migrate carefully during low usage
- **Downloads (VM 101)**: Active downloads must not corrupt - verify no active downloads before migration
- **Arr services (VM 102)**: Media automation pipeline - migrate during low activity period

**Mitigation strategy:**
- Migrate non-critical first to gain confidence
- Backup all critical service configs before touching
- Migrate critical services during 3-6 AM window (low usage)
- Test each critical service thoroughly after migration
- Have rollback plan ready for each critical service
- Coordinate with Media Stack Agent for critical service migrations

### Rollback Plan

**Applicable for**: Docker stack configuration changes

**How to rollback if this goes wrong:**

**Per-service rollback:**
1. `git revert` the commit that updated the service's docker-compose.yml
2. Redeploy service via Portainer (pull and redeploy)
3. Verify service accessible via IP again
4. Test service functionality

**Bitwarden CLI rollback:**
1. Run: `bw config server http://192.168.86.249:8111`
2. Test: `bw login` and `bw sync`
3. Verify secrets retrieval works

**Full rollback (nuclear option):**
1. Revert all git commits made during this task
2. Redeploy all affected stacks via Portainer
3. Reset Bitwarden CLI to IP
4. Verify all services accessible and functional
5. Pi-hole stays running (not causing harm with IPs)

**Recovery time estimate**:
- Single service: 2-5 minutes
- All services: 15-30 minutes

**Backup requirements:**
- All changes in git (automatic backup via version control)
- Document Bitwarden CLI original config before changing
- Take Portainer stack backups before critical service migrations

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Tools (Low Risk)

**Primary Agent**: `security`

- [ ] **Backup Bitwarden CLI configuration** `[agent:security]`

## Testing Plan

**[[docs/agents/TESTING|Testing Agent]] validates:**
- Bitwarden CLI can login, sync, retrieve secrets
- All services accessible via DNS names
- Inter-service communication works (arr ‚Üí prowlarr, arr ‚Üí downloaders)
- Critical services fully functional (Emby streams, downloads complete)
- No DNS resolution errors in Pi-hole logs
- Automation scripts execute successfully

**Manual validation:**
1. **Bitwarden CLI test**:
   ```bash
   bw config server  # Should show vaultwarden.local.infinity-node.com
   bw login
   bw sync
   bw get item <test-item>  # Should retrieve successfully
   ```

2. **Service accessibility test**:
   ```bash
   # Test each service via DNS name in browser
   # All should load correctly
   ```

3. **Inter-service communication test**:
   ```bash
   # In Sonarr: trigger manual search
   # Expected: Prowlarr returns results, can send to downloader
   ```

4. **Emby functionality test**:
   ```bash
   # Play media file
   # Trigger transcode (incompatible format/resolution)
   # Expected: Smooth playback, transcoding works
   ```

5. **Downloads test**:
   ```bash
   # Send test download from arr service
   # Expected: Appears in download client, completes successfully
   ```

## Notes

**Priority Rationale:**
Priority 3 (medium) because:
- Builds on IN-034 infrastructure work
- Important for long-term maintainability
- Reduces technical debt significantly
- Not urgent - IP-based access still works
- Can be scheduled for low-usage window to minimize risk

Not higher priority because:
- Not addressing active outage
- Current IP-based setup functional
- Can delay if higher priority work emerges

**Complexity Rationale:**
Moderate complexity because:
- Touches many services across multiple VMs
- Requires careful testing of each migration
- Critical services require extra caution and timing
- Inter-service dependencies must be validated
- Some discovery needed (which services reference IPs?)

Not simple because affects critical services and requires phased approach.
Not complex because straightforward replacements, no major unknowns.

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Migration order matters**: Non-critical ‚Üí medium-risk ‚Üí critical
- **Test after each phase**: Don't migrate everything then test
- **Commit granularly**: One commit per service or logical group for easy rollback
- **Timing for critical services**: 3-6 AM preferred for Emby/downloads migration
- **DNS name format**: Use consistent `<service>.local.infinity-node.com` pattern
- **Ports still in configs**: DNS resolves hostname only, ports still specified in configs
- **Keep calm, rollback easy**: Everything in git, can revert quickly if needed

**Follow-up Tasks:**
- Future: Audit for any missed hardcoded IPs (periodic review)
- Future: Consider DNS-based service discovery in docker networks (docker internal DNS)
- Future: Update deployment scripts to use DNS (if any new scripts added)

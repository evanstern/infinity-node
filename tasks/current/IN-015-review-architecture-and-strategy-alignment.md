# Task: IN-015 - Review Architecture and Strategy Alignment

## Description

Comprehensive review of all project documentation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and alignment with project goals. Identify and fix any outdated or incorrect information, evaluate current strategy against stated objectives, and propose new tasks or strategy adjustments as needed.

## Context

After completing the infrastructure import (IN-001), we have a large body of documentation across multiple files. It's important to:
- Ensure all documentation accurately reflects current state
- Verify consistency across related documents
- Confirm we're still aligned with project goals
- Identify gaps or needed improvements
- Update strategy if requirements have changed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Review all files in `docs/` directory for accuracy
  - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - Verify VM details, service lists, resource allocations
  - [ ] CLAUDE.md - Ensure workflow guidance is current
  - [ ] DECISIONS.md - Check all ADRs are documented
  - [ ] SECRET-MANAGEMENT.md - Verify strategy and current state
  - [ ] All `docs/agents/*.md` files - Ensure agent specs are accurate
- [ ] Review all stack README files in `stacks/` for consistency
  - [ ] Verify metadata is complete and accurate
  - [ ] Check secret documentation is consistent
  - [ ] Ensure deployment instructions are current

- List of prioritized improvements

**Follow-up:**
- New tasks for identified gaps
- Strategy adjustments if needed
- Improved documentation quality
- Better alignment with goals

### Priority Rationale

High priority because:
- Foundation for all future work
- Prevents building on incorrect assumptions
- Ensures team has accurate information
- Strategic review is overdue after major import work
- Identifies highest-value next steps

## Review Findings

### ARCHITECTURE.md Issues

**1. Known Issue #2 - Outdated Secret Migration Status**
- **Current text:** "Secret migration in progress: Vaultwarden strategy established, secrets being migrated"
- **Problem:** Outdated and vague. IN-001 completed documentation patterns. IN-002 is the actual pending migration work.
- **Recommendation:** Update to: "Secret migration pending: All stack docs reference Vaultwarden (completed in IN-001). Actual .env migration pending (IN-002)."

**2. Known Issue #3 - Inconsistent Task Reference Format**
- **Current text:** `[[tasks/backlog/setup-local-dns-service-discovery]]`
- **Problem:** Missing IN-012 prefix, inconsistent with new task naming convention
- **Recommendation:** Update to `[[tasks/backlog/IN-012-setup-local-dns-service-discovery|IN-012]]`

**3. Known Issue #8 - Too Vague After Stack Import**
- **Current text:** "Documentation incomplete: Service-specific docs needed"
- **Problem:** We just imported 24 service stack READMEs with comprehensive documentation. This is no longer accurate.
- **Recommendation:** Either remove this item or make it specific about what's actually missing (e.g., "Runbooks for common operations incomplete" or "Agent-specific workflow docs need expansion")

**4. Change Log Missing Recent Major Work**
- **Problem:** No entry for 2025-10-26 when we completed IN-001 (infrastructure import, 24 stacks documented, wiki-links added)
- **Recommendation:** Add changelog entry: "2025-10-26 | Completed infrastructure import (IN-001): 24 service stacks documented, wiki-links added to all services | Claude Code + Evan"

### CLAUDE.md Issues

**1. Task ID System Not Documented**
- **Problem:** New task ID system (IN-NNN) implemented in IN-001 but not mentioned in CLAUDE.md workflow guide
- **Impact:** Users don't know how to reference tasks using the new ID system
- **Recommendation:** Add section under "MDTD Workflow" explaining:
  - Task IDs format (IN-NNN)
  - How to reference tasks ("work on IN-001" instead of full name)
  - Benefits (easier communication, shorter references)

**2. ✅ Good:** `/commit` command is properly documented

---

### DECISIONS.md Issues

**1. ✅ Good:** All 11 ADRs documented and comprehensive (ADR-001 through ADR-011)

**2. Future Decisions List Needs Update**
- **Current text:** "Secret Management - Final approach, backup strategy"
- **Problem:** Decisions about secret management have been made and implemented:
  - Vaultwarden chosen and deployed (setup-vaultwarden-secret-storage completed)
  - Stack READMEs document secrets with Vaultwarden references (IN-001 completed)
  - .env migration pending (IN-002)
- **Recommendation:** Update or remove this item. If keeping, be specific about what's still undecided (e.g., "Secret backup and rotation strategy")

**3. ADR-008 Status**
- **Observation:** ADR-008 (Use Git for Configuration Management) was recently validated by completing IN-001 (all stacks now in git)
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding note to ADR-008 referencing IN-001 completion as validation of this decision

---

### SECRET-MANAGEMENT.md Issues

**1. ✅ Good:** Comprehensive documentation of Vaultwarden setup, CLI usage, and workflows

**2. Task References Need Updates**
- **Current:** Links to `tasks/current/setup-vaultwarden-secret-storage` and `tasks/backlog/setup-local-dns-service-discovery`
- **Problem:**
  - setup-vaultwarden-secret-storage is now completed (in tasks/completed/)
  - setup-local-dns-service-discovery needs IN-012 prefix
- **Recommendation:** Update references to:
  - `[[tasks/completed/setup-vaultwarden-secret-storage|Setup Task]]` - mark as completed
  - `[[tasks/backlog/IN-012-setup-local-dns-service-discovery|IN-012]]`

---

### Agent Documentation (docs/agents/)

**✅ Good:** All 7 agent specs (DOCKER, DOCUMENTATION, INFRASTRUCTURE, MEDIA, SECURITY, TESTING + README) are comprehensive and current

### Stack README Files

**✅ Good:** Stack READMEs are highly consistent with comprehensive Obsidian metadata
- All have proper frontmatter (type, service, category, vms, priority, status, etc.)
- Tags are well-organized and useful
- Documentation is thorough

---

## Goal Alignment Assessment

### Project Goals (from CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE.md):
1. **Document Everything** - About the setup
2. **Maintain Services** - Keep infrastructure reliable

- ⚠️ Gap: No disaster recovery testing (IN-008 in backlog)
- **Assessment:** Basic maintenance good, but need better observability and DR planning

**Goal 3: Automate ⏳ IN PROGRESS**
- ✅ Secret management utilities created (create/update/delete-secret.sh)
- ✅ Git-based configuration management in place (IN-001 completed)
- ✅ Portainer Git integration strategy documented
- ⏳ Portainer API automation pending (IN-013 in backlog)
- ⏳ Deployment runbooks pending (IN-003 in backlog)
- ❌ No backup automation yet
- ❌ No automated recovery procedures
- **Assessment:** Foundation in place, but significant automation work remains

**Goal 4: Learn ✅ GOOD**
- ✅ ADRs document decisions and rationale
- ✅ Task system tracks what we've learned
- ✅ Completed tasks document lessons learned
- ✅ This review task (IN-015) shows we're reflecting on process
- **Assessment:** Good practices for learning and continuous improvement

**Overall Alignment:** 🟢 GOOD - Strong on documentation and learning, need more work on automation and observability

## Strategy Evaluation

### Current Strategies - Are They Working?

**1. Hybrid Git + Portainer Approach (ADR-008)** ✅ **VALIDATED**
- IN-001 successfully imported all 24 stacks to Git
- Strategy is sound and working well
- Next step: IN-013 to automate Portainer Git integration

**2. Vaultwarden for Secret Management** ✅ **WORKING WELL**
- Successfully deployed and in use
- Documentation comprehensive
- CLI automation working
- Minor gap: IP address dependency (addressed by IN-012 local DNS task)

**3. Agent-Based Workflow (ADR-010)** ✅ **EFFECTIVE**
- 7 specialized agents working well
- Clear separation of concerns
- Coordination documented

**4. Critical Services Prioritization (ADR-011)** ✅ **VALIDATED**
- Clear focus on household-affecting services
- Appropriate caution during IN-001 import work
- Strategy proven effective

**5. MDTD Task Management** ✅ **IMPROVED**
- Task ID system (IN-NNN) just added - major improvement
- Numeric priorities just added - better granularity
- Dashboard queries updated
- System working well

### Areas Needing Strategy Evolution

**1. Monitoring & Alerting - NEEDED**
- Current: Manual checks only
- Recommendation: Prioritize IN-005 (setup monitoring/alerting)
- Impact: Critical for Goal #2 (Maintain Services)

**2. Backup & DR - CRITICAL GAP**
- Current: Strategy undefined
- Recommendation: Prioritize IN-011 (document backup strategy)
- Should happen before adding more services/complexity

**3. Automation Maturity - NEEDS ATTENTION**
- Current: Manual deployment, some scripts
- Recommendation: Complete IN-013 (Portainer automation) and IN-003 (deployment runbooks)
- Would significantly advance Goal #3

---

## Summary of Findings

### Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
*None - all issues are minor documentation updates*

### High Priority Issues (Fix Soon)
1. Task reference formats need IN- prefixes (ARCHITECTURE.md, SECRET-MANAGEMENT.md)
2. Known Issues section in ARCHITECTURE.md needs updating
3. Change log in ARCHITECTURE.md missing 2025-10-26 entries
4. Task ID system not documented in CLAUDE.md

### Medium Priority Issues
1. DECISIONS.md "Future Decisions" list needs updating (secret management item)
2. ADR-008 could reference IN-001 completion as validation

### Strategic Recommendations
1. **Prioritize observability:** Move IN-005 (monitoring) and IN-011 (backup) higher in backlog
2. **Complete automation foundation:** IN-013 (Portainer) and IN-003 (runbooks) before adding new services
3. **Consider new ADR:** Document task ID system and numeric priorities as ADR-012

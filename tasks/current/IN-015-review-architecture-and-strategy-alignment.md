# Task: IN-015 - Review Architecture and Strategy Alignment

## Description

Comprehensive review of all project documentation to ensure accuracy, consistency, and alignment with project goals. Identify and fix any outdated or incorrect information, evaluate current strategy against stated objectives, and propose new tasks or strategy adjustments as needed.

## Context

After completing the infrastructure import (IN-001), we have a large body of documentation across multiple files. It's important to:
- Ensure all documentation accurately reflects current state
- Verify consistency across related documents
- Confirm we're still aligned with project goals
- Identify gaps or needed improvements
- Update strategy if requirements have changed

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Review all files in `docs/` directory for accuracy
  - [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md - Verify VM details, service lists, resource allocations
  - [ ] CLAUDE.md - Ensure workflow guidance is current
  - [ ] DECISIONS.md - Check all ADRs are documented
  - [ ] SECRET-MANAGEMENT.md - Verify strategy and current state
  - [ ] All `docs/agents/*.md` files - Ensure agent specs are accurate
- [ ] Review all stack README files in `stacks/` for consistency
  - [ ] Verify metadata is complete and accurate
  - [ ] Check secret documentation is consistent
  - [ ] Ensure deployment instructions are current
- [ ] Identify and document inconsistencies found

### Goal Alignment Check
- [ ] Review project goals (documented in CLAUDE.md and ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [ ] Evaluate current state against each goal
- [ ] Identify gaps between goals and current implementation
- [ ] Document alignment assessment

### Current Project Goals (from documentation):
1. **Document Everything** - About the setup
2. **Maintain Services** - Keep infrastructure reliable
3. **Automate** - Deployment, updates, recovery
4. **Learn** - Improve process over time

### Strategy Evaluation
- [ ] Review current architectural decisions (DECISIONS.md ADRs)
- [ ] Assess if decisions are still valid given current state
- [ ] Identify areas where strategy should evolve
- [ ] Propose specific changes or improvements

### Fix Identified Issues
- [ ] Update any outdated information found
- [ ] Correct inconsistencies across documents
- [ ] Improve clarity where documentation is confusing
- [ ] Add missing information identified during review

### Propose New Work
- [ ] Create new tasks for gaps identified
- [ ] Propose strategy adjustments if needed
- [ ] Prioritize proposed work based on impact
- [ ] Document rationale for proposals

## Dependencies

- Access to all documentation
- Understanding of current infrastructure state
- Knowledge of project history and goals

## Testing Plan

[[docs/agents/DOCUMENTATION|Documentation Agent]] should validate:
- All wiki-links resolve correctly
- YAML frontmatter is valid
- Cross-references are accurate
- No broken links or references
- Documentation is internally consistent

## Related Documentation

- [[docs/ARCHITECTURE|Architecture]]
- [[docs/CLAUDE|Claude Code Guide]]
- [[docs/DECISIONS|Decisions]]
- [[docs/SECRET-MANAGEMENT|Secret Management]]
- [[tasks/completed/IN-001-import-existing-docker-configs|IN-001]] - Recent major work that added many docs

## Notes

### Areas of Particular Interest

**Recently Changed:**
- Stack documentation (24 new READMEs added)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (updated with service details)
- Task system (task IDs added)

**Likely Need Updates:**
- Known Issues section in ARCHITECTURE.md (may have new items)
- Service counts and resource usage
- Backup strategy documentation (marked as TBD)
- Monitoring section (marked as TBD)

**Strategy Questions to Consider:**
- Is the hybrid Git + Portainer approach working well?
- Should we adjust our secret management strategy?
- Are we on track with automation goals?
- Do we need better monitoring before continuing?
- Is the current VM allocation optimal?

### Expected Outcomes

**Immediate:**
- All documentation accurate and consistent
- Clear understanding of current vs. desired state
- List of prioritized improvements

**Follow-up:**
- New tasks for identified gaps
- Strategy adjustments if needed
- Improved documentation quality
- Better alignment with goals

### Priority Rationale

High priority because:
- Foundation for all future work
- Prevents building on incorrect assumptions
- Ensures team has accurate information
- Strategic review is overdue after major import work
- Identifies highest-value next steps

**Note:** This is a comprehensive review task. It may spawn multiple follow-up tasks based on findings. Break down into smaller chunks if needed during execution.

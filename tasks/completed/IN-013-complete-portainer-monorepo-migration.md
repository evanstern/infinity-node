# Task: IN-013 - Complete Portainer Stack Migration to Monorepo

> **Quick Summary**: Migrate the final 7 Portainer stacks from standalone GitHub repos to the infinity-node monorepo, completing the GitOps infrastructure consolidation started in October 2025.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**

We have partially completed the Portainer stack migration:
- ‚úÖ **17 stacks** successfully migrated to monorepo (VM 100: 3, VM 102: 9, VM 103: 3, Emby)
- ‚ùå **7 stacks** still pointing to old standalone repos that need migration:
  - **VM 101 (Downloads - CRITICAL):** `downloads` (ID: 2), `watchtower` (ID: 5)
  - **VM 103 (Misc):** `vaultwarden` (ID: 8), `watchtower` (ID: 9), `newt` (ID: 10), `audiobookshelf` (ID: 11), `navidrome` (ID: 12)

**Current issues:**
- Inconsistent deployment sources (monorepo vs. 7 standalone repos)
- 14 total repositories to maintain (1 monorepo + 13 standalone repos)
- Cannot archive old repos until migration complete
- Technical debt from incomplete migration

**Why now?**

Migration was paused on 2025-10-29 due to network access interruption. Now that access is restored:
- Infrastructure is stable (17 previous migrations successful, zero issues)
- Scripts are proven and battle-tested
- Completing this unblocks archiving 13 standalone repos
- Good time to finish what we started

**Who benefits?**

- **Operations:** Single source of truth, simplified management, cleaner disaster recovery
- **Maintenance:** Reduce repo sprawl from 14 ‚Üí 1 repository
- **Future work:** Clean foundation for monitoring and automation
- **Documentation:** All infrastructure configs in one place

## Solution Design

### Approach

**Use proven `update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh` script** (battle-tested on 17 successful migrations):

**Script functionality:**
- Retrieves Portainer credentials from Vaultwarden automatically
- Updates stack Git URL from `https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node-stack-*` ‚Üí `https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node`
- Updates compose file path from `docker-compose.yml` ‚Üí `stacks/{service}/docker-compose.yml`
- Preserves all environment variables (lesson learned from previous migrations)
- Redeploys stack from new repository location
- Zero-downtime atomic update

**Why this approach:**
- ‚úÖ Script proven with 17 successful migrations, zero production issues
- ‚úÖ All stacks already have GitOps enabled (5-minute polling)
- ‚úÖ All stacks already exist in monorepo structure
- ‚úÖ Just updating Git pointers - no compose changes needed
- ‚úÖ Rollback is simple (revert Git URL via API)

**Migration order: Low-risk ‚Üí Medium-risk ‚Üí High-risk**
1. Low-risk: audiobookshelf, navidrome, watchtower (VM 103), newt (media libraries, auto-updater)
2. Medium-risk: vaultwarden (critical infrastructure but good backup strategy)
3. High-risk: downloads, watchtower (VM 101) - CRITICAL household-facing services

**No alternative approaches needed** - the current script and process work perfectly.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Vaultwarden Migration Fails ‚Üí All Secrets Inaccessible
**Impact:** HIGH - Vaultwarden contains ALL infrastructure secrets (API tokens, passwords)

**Likelihood:** LOW - Migration is just Git URL update, database untouched

**Mitigation:**
- Verify recent automated backup exists (daily backup already configured)
- Test backup file integrity before migration
- Document exact rollback procedure
- Keep old Git URL readily available

**Rollback procedure:**
```bash
# Revert via Portainer API (< 1 minute)
curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://192.168.86.249:9443/api/stacks/8/git" \
  -d '{"RepositoryURL": "https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node-stack-vaultwarden", ...}'
```

**Recovery:** Restore database from NAS backup if corruption occurs (documented in backup script)

### Risk 2: Downloads VPN Doesn't Reconnect ‚Üí Active Torrents Stop
**Impact:** HIGH - Household-facing service, breaks media download pipeline

**Likelihood:** LOW - VPN container should reconnect automatically on redeploy

**Mitigation:**
- Migrate during low-usage window (3-6 AM preferred)
- Backup downloads config directory before migration
- Test VPN external IP immediately after migration
- Monitor for 30+ minutes before declaring success
- Verify arr services can still communicate with downloads

**Rollback procedure:**
```bash
# Revert Git URL via API (2-3 minutes including redeploy)
curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: ${TOKEN}" \
  "https://192.168.86.173:32768/api/stacks/2/git" \
  -d '{"RepositoryURL": "https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node-stack-downloads", ...}'
```

**Recovery:** Restore config from backup if needed

### Risk 3: Configuration Paths Break After Migration
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Services fail to start with missing config

**Likelihood:** VERY LOW - Already solved in previous 17 migrations

**Mitigation:**
- Use absolute paths for CONFIG_PATH (lesson learned from VM 102 migrations)
- All compose files already use correct absolute paths
- Scripts preserve environment variables

**Resolution:** Already handled - previous migrations validated this approach

### Risk 4: Environment Variables Lost During Migration
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Services fail to start with missing configuration

**Likelihood:** VERY LOW - Script already handles this correctly

**Mitigation:**
- Script retrieves current env vars and passes them in update
- Lesson learned from linkwarden migration (must pass full Env array)

**Resolution:** Already handled in script

## Scope Definition

### ‚úÖ In Scope

**What we're doing:**
- Migrate 7 remaining stacks from standalone repos ‚Üí monorepo
- Backup critical services before migration (vaultwarden DB, downloads config)
- Validate all services healthy and functional after migration
- Test GitOps update mechanism on newly migrated stacks
- Verify critical services extensively (vaultwarden, downloads)
- Document any new lessons learned
- Create follow-up task for archiving old standalone repos

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

**What we're NOT doing (separate tasks or future work):**
- Archiving the 13 standalone GitHub repos (follow-up task)
- Changing any docker-compose file configurations
- Modifying environment variables or secrets
- Setting up monitoring/alerting for stack updates
- Configuring Portainer webhooks
- Making any infrastructure changes to VMs
- Upgrading Portainer versions

### üéØ MVP - Minimum Viable Completion

**Smallest version we can call "done":**
- All 7 stacks point to monorepo with correct compose paths
- All services running and healthy (containers up, no errors in logs)
- Critical services validated (vaultwarden secrets accessible, downloads VPN connected)
- GitOps confirmed working via test update on one migrated stack
- Follow-up task created for repo archival

**Nice-to-have (not required for completion):**
- Testing GitOps on all 7 stacks (test on 1-2 is sufficient)
- Extended monitoring period (30 minutes minimum, longer is better but not required)
- Performance comparisons (not necessary, just needs to work)

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation & Backup

**Primary Agent:** `docker` (coordination with `security` for vaultwarden)

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

- [ ] **Re-inventory all VMs to confirm current state**
  ```bash
  for vm in 100 101 102 103; do
    export BW_SESSION=$(cat ~/.bw-session)
    ./scripts/infrastructure/query-portainer-stacks.sh \
      --secret "portainer-api-token-vm-$vm" \
      --collection "shared"
  done
  ```
  - Verify 7 stacks still need migration
  - Confirm all services currently healthy
  - Document any changes since last inventory

- [ ] **Backup vaultwarden database** [agent:security]
  ```bash
  ssh evan@192.168.86.249 "/home/evan/scripts/backup-vaultwarden.sh"

  # Verify backup exists and is recent
  ssh backup@192.168.86.43 "ls -lh /volume1/backups/vaultwarden/ | tail -3"
  ```
  - Confirm backup completed successfully
  - Note backup filename and timestamp
  - Verify file size is reasonable (~few MB)

- [ ] **Backup downloads config directory** [agent:docker]

### Phase 3: Medium-Risk Migration (Vaultwarden)

**Primary Agent:** `security` (coordination with `docker`)

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE** - Contains all secrets for entire infrastructure

**Pre-migration checklist:**
- [ ] Recent vaultwarden backup verified (from Phase 1)
- [ ] Backup integrity confirmed (file exists, reasonable size)
- [ ] Rollback procedure reviewed and ready
- [ ] BW_SESSION still valid for post-migration testing

#### Migrate vaultwarden (ID: 8)

  ./scripts/infrastructure/update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh \
    portainer-api-token-vm-103 \
    shared \
    8 \
    1 \
    vaultwarden \
    stacks/vaultwarden/docker-compose.yml
  ```

- [ ] **Extensive validation** [agent:security]

  **Container health:**
  - Container started successfully
  - No errors in logs (check for database issues)
  - Process running normally

  **Web UI access:**
  - Test web UI: https://192.168.86.249:8111
  - Can log in successfully
  - Can view collections
  - Can view items

  **Bitwarden CLI access:**
  ```bash
  # Test CLI still works
  export BW_SESSION=$(cat ~/.bw-session)
  bw status  # Should show "unlocked"
  bw sync    # Should sync successfully
  ```

  **Secret retrieval test:**
  ```bash
  # Test retrieving a known secret
  ./scripts/secrets/get-vw-secret.sh \
    "portainer-api-token-vm-103" \
    "shared"
  # Should return token successfully
  ```

  **Portainer API tokens still work:**
  ```bash
  # Test querying with existing token
  ./scripts/infrastructure/query-portainer-stacks.sh \
    --secret "portainer-api-token-vm-103" \
    --collection "shared"
  # Should successfully query stacks
  ```

  **Git config updated:**
  - Verify in Portainer UI stack points to monorepo
  - Verify compose path correct: `stacks/vaultwarden/docker-compose.yml`

**If any validation fails:**
- Execute rollback immediately (see rollback procedure in Risk Assessment section)
- Investigate issue before retry
- Consider restoring database backup if database corruption suspected

### Phase 4: High-Risk Migrations (VM 101 Critical Services)

**Primary Agent:** `media` (coordination with `docker` and `testing`)

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL HOUSEHOLD-FACING SERVICES** - Downloads is primary media acquisition pipeline

**Timing consideration:** Prefer off-hours (3-6 AM) to minimize household impact

**Pre-migration checklist:**
- [ ] Downloads config backup verified (from Phase 1)
- [ ] Low-usage time window (or household notified)
- [ ] Rollback procedure reviewed
- [ ] Ready to monitor for extended period (30+ minutes)

#### Stack 1: watchtower (ID: 5) - Lower risk first

- [ ] **Migrate watchtower**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/infrastructure/update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh \
    portainer-api-token-vm-101 \
    shared \
    5 \
    2 \
    watchtower \
    stacks/watchtower/docker-compose.yml
  ```

- [ ] **Validate watchtower** [agent:testing]
  - Container started successfully
  - No errors in logs
  - Watchtower checking for updates
  - Git config updated to monorepo

#### Stack 2: downloads (ID: 2) - MOST CRITICAL

- [ ] **Migrate downloads** ‚ö†Ô∏è
  ```bash
  ./scripts/infrastructure/update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh \
    portainer-api-token-vm-101 \
    shared \
    2 \
    2 \
    downloads \
    stacks/downloads/docker-compose.yml
  ```

- [ ] **Enhanced validation for downloads** [agent:media]

  **Container health:**
  - All containers started (VPN, qBittorrent, any others)
  - No errors in logs
  - All processes running

  **VPN connectivity (CRITICAL):**
  ```bash
  # Check VPN container IP
  ssh evan@192.168.86.173 "docker exec <vpn-container-name> curl -s ifconfig.me"
  # Should return VPN IP, NOT home IP (192.168.x.x)
  ```
  - Verify IP is VPN provider IP
  - Verify NOT showing home public IP
  - VPN connection stable (no reconnection loops in logs)

  **qBittorrent functionality:**
  - Web UI accessible
  - Can log in
  - Existing torrents still visible
  - Torrents still seeding/downloading
  - Can add test torrent (small, legal file)
  - Test torrent starts downloading

  **Arr service integration:**

  - Test from Sonarr: Search episode, attempt to download
  - Verify arr services can communicate with qBittorrent
  - Verify download clients still configured correctly in arr services

  **Git config updated:**
  - Verify in Portainer UI stack points to monorepo
  - Verify compose path: `stacks/downloads/docker-compose.yml`

  **Extended monitoring:**
  - [ ] Monitor for 30+ minutes after migration
  - [ ] Check logs periodically for errors
  - [ ] Verify torrents continue seeding
  - [ ] Verify VPN stays connected
  - [ ] Confirm no household complaints

**If any validation fails:**
- Execute rollback immediately
- Restore config from backup if needed
- Investigate root cause before retry

**Phase 4 Summary Check:**
- [ ] Both VM 101 stacks migrated successfully
- [ ] Downloads VPN connected and stable
- [ ] Torrents working normally
- [ ] Arr integration confirmed working
- [ ] Extended monitoring period completed

### Phase 5: Final Validation

**Primary Agent:** `testing`

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

- [ ] **Complete inventory verification**
  ```bash
  # Query all VMs
  for vm in 100 101 102 103; do
    echo "=== VM $vm ==="
    export BW_SESSION=$(cat ~/.bw-session)
    ./scripts/infrastructure/query-portainer-stacks.sh \
      --secret "portainer-api-token-vm-$vm" \
      --collection "shared"
  done
  ```
  - Verify all 24 stacks point to monorepo
  - Confirm all have GitOps enabled (5-minute polling)
  - Verify all stacks showing "Active" status
  - Document any anomalies

- [ ] **Test GitOps update mechanism**

  Pick one recently migrated stack (e.g., navidrome):
  - Make trivial change to `stacks/navidrome/docker-compose.yml`
    - Example: Add comment or adjust formatting
  - Commit and push to monorepo
  - Wait 5+ minutes
  - Check Portainer UI: Should show update detected
  - Allow Portainer to deploy update
  - Verify stack remains healthy after GitOps update
  - Revert trivial change, commit, verify auto-update again

- [ ] **Critical service end-to-end tests** [agent:media] [agent:security]

  **Emby streaming test:**
  - Browse library
  - Start playing video
  - Verify playback smooth
  - Stop playback

  **Downloads pipeline test:**
  - Add test torrent to qBittorrent
  - Verify download starts
  - Verify VPN IP still correct
  - Clean up test torrent

  **Arr ‚Üí Downloads integration test:**
  - Search for item in Radarr
  - Send to downloads
  - Verify appears in qBittorrent
  - Cancel test download

  **Vaultwarden access test:**
  - Retrieve a test secret via CLI
  - Access web UI
  - Verify Portainer API calls still work

  **All services health check:**
  - Review all container logs for errors
  - Verify no unusual CPU/memory usage
  - Confirm no failed deployments in Portainer

- [ ] **Verify all 24 stacks healthy**

- [ ] **Update task completion notes**
  - Document any issues encountered and resolutions
  - Note any new lessons learned
  - Record final inventory results
  - Update task status to completed
  - Move task to `completed/` directory

- [ ] **Create follow-up task for archiving old repos**

  Create new task: "Archive Standalone Portainer Stack Repositories"
  - List all 13 repos to archive:
    - infinity-node-stack-downloads
    - infinity-node-stack-watchtower (multiple?)
    - infinity-node-stack-vaultwarden
    - infinity-node-stack-newt
    - infinity-node-stack-audiobookshelf

    - (and others from original migration)
  - Process for each:
    - Add archive notice to README
    - Set repository to archived status on GitHub
    - Document in migration log
  - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours
  - Priority: 6 (low - cleanup work)

- [ ] **Update documentation if needed**
  - Update `stacks/README.md` if changes needed
  - Update `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` if workflow changed
  - Ensure `docs/runbooks/portainer-stack-migration.md` is current
  - Update `scripts/README.md` if script usage changed

- [ ] **Review scripts documentation**

## Rollback Plan

### Per-Stack Rollback (Quick - < 2 minutes)

**If individual stack fails after migration:**

**Option 1: Via Portainer UI (Fastest)**
1. Navigate to Portainer UI ‚Üí Stacks ‚Üí Click problem stack
2. Click "Editor" tab
3. Change "Repository URL" back to old repo:
   - Format: `https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node-stack-{service}`
4. Change "Compose path" back to: `docker-compose.yml`
5. Click "Update the stack"
6. Verify service recovers

**Option 2: Via API (Scriptable)**

For VM 103 stacks:
```bash
export BW_SESSION=$(cat ~/.bw-session)
STACK_ID=<id>  # e.g., 11 for audiobookshelf
SERVICE=<name>  # e.g., "audiobookshelf"

# Get credentials
CREDS=$(./scripts/secrets/get-vw-secret.sh "portainer-api-token-vm-103" "shared")

# Revert Git config
curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CREDS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://192.168.86.249:9443/api/stacks/$STACK_ID/git" \
  -d "{
    \"RepositoryURL\": \"https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node-stack-$SERVICE\",
    \"RepositoryReferenceName\": \"\",
    \"ComposeFilePathInRepository\": \"docker-compose.yml\"
  }"

# Redeploy from old repo
curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CREDS" \
  "https://192.168.86.249:9443/api/stacks/$STACK_ID/git/redeploy?endpointId=1"
```

For VM 101 stacks (note different port and endpoint ID):
```bash
# downloads: ID 2, watchtower: ID 5
# Port: 32768 (not 9443)
# Endpoint ID: 2 (not 1)

curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CREDS" \
  "https://192.168.86.173:32768/api/stacks/$STACK_ID/git" \
  -d "{...}"  # Same JSON as above

curl -sk -X PUT \
  -H "X-API-Key: $CREDS" \
  "https://192.168.86.173:32768/api/stacks/$STACK_ID/git/redeploy?endpointId=2"
```

### Database Restore (Vaultwarden)

**If vaultwarden database corrupted:**

```bash
# Stop vaultwarden container
ssh evan@192.168.86.249 "docker stop vaultwarden"

# Backup broken database
ssh evan@192.168.86.249 "cd /home/evan/data/vw-data && \
  mv db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.broken-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Restore from NAS backup
ssh evan@192.168.86.249 "scp backup@192.168.86.43:/volume1/backups/vaultwarden/vaultwarden-backup-YYYYMMDD.sqlite3 \
  /home/evan/data/vw-data/db.sqlite3"

# Start vaultwarden
ssh evan@192.168.86.249 "docker start vaultwarden"

# Verify restoration
bw sync
bw status  # Should show unlocked and synced
```

### Config Restore (Downloads)

**If downloads config corrupted:**

```bash
# Stop downloads stack
ssh evan@192.168.86.173 "cd /home/evan/projects/infinity-node/stacks/downloads && \
  docker-compose down"

# Backup broken config
ssh evan@192.168.86.173 "cd /home/evan/projects/infinity-node/stacks/downloads && \
  mv config config.broken-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

# Restore from backup
ssh evan@192.168.86.173 "cd /home/evan/projects/infinity-node/stacks/downloads && \
  tar -xzf ~/backups/downloads-config-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.tar.gz"

# Restart stack
ssh evan@192.168.86.173 "cd /home/evan/projects/infinity-node/stacks/downloads && \
  docker-compose up -d"

# Verify VPN and torrents
```

### Nuclear Option (Revert All Migrations)

**Only if multiple stacks failing or severe issues:**

1. **Document current state:**
   - Take inventory of what's broken
   - Note which stacks were successfully migrated
   - Capture error logs

2. **Revert each migrated stack** (use per-stack rollback procedure above):
   - Start with critical services (downloads, vaultwarden)
   - Then revert others in reverse migration order

3. **Verify all services operational:**
   - Check all containers running
   - Verify critical services functional
   - Confirm no errors in logs

4. **Analyze root cause:**
   - Review what went wrong
   - Update migration procedures if needed
   - Consider if approach needs adjustment
   - Document findings before retry

5. **Plan retry:**
   - Address root cause issues
   - Update scripts or procedures
   - Consider smaller batch sizes
   - Schedule new migration attempt

**After any rollback:**
- Document what went wrong in task notes
- Update risk assessment if new risks discovered
- Improve mitigation strategies
- Test fixes before retry

## Dependencies

**Prerequisites (All Met):**
- ‚úÖ Portainer API tokens stored in Vaultwarden
- ‚úÖ All stacks exist in monorepo `stacks/` directory
- ‚úÖ GitOps enabled on all stacks
- ‚úÖ `update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh` script proven (17 successful migrations)
- ‚úÖ Backup infrastructure in place (vaultwarden daily backup, NAS storage)
- ‚úÖ Previous migration work completed (17 stacks already on monorepo)

**Blocks:**
- Archiving 13 standalone repos (follow-up task to be created)
- Full GitOps automation strategy (future work)
- Centralized monitoring setup (future work)

**Related Tasks:**
- Based on original IN-013 (paused 2025-10-29)
- Builds on work from previous migration sessions (Oct 28-29, 2025)
- References: [[tasks/current/IN-013-migrate-portainer-to-monorepo|Original IN-013 Task]]

## Notes

### Key Scripts to Use

**Primary migration script:**
```bash
./scripts/infrastructure/update-git-stack-to-monorepo.sh \
  <vaultwarden-secret-name> \
  <vaultwarden-collection> \
  <stack-id> \
  <endpoint-id> \
  <stack-name> \
  <new-compose-path>
```

**Supporting scripts:**
- `query-portainer-stacks.sh` - Inventory and validation
- `backup-vaultwarden.sh` - Database backup (already deployed on VM 103)
- `verify-stack-health.sh` - Container health validation
- `get-vw-secret.sh` - Retrieve Portainer API tokens

### Important Context from Original IN-013

**Previous migration results (Oct 28-29, 2025):**
- 17 stacks migrated successfully
- Zero production issues
- All services remained healthy
- Scripts proven reliable

**Lessons learned:**
1. **env_file directive incompatible with Git-based stacks** - Use explicit environment variable mappings
2. **GitOps update endpoint requires full Env array** - Empty array clears all variables
3. **Use absolute paths for CONFIG_PATH** - Relative paths fail with Git deployments
4. **Always backup databases before migrating** - Especially for services with SQLite/PostgreSQL
5. **Script preserves environment variables** - Must pass full array when updating Git config

**Configuration details:**
- Monorepo: `https://github.com/evanstern/infinity-node`
- Compose paths: `stacks/{service}/docker-compose.yml`
- GitOps polling: 5-minute interval
- All tokens in Vaultwarden `shared` collection

### VM-Specific Notes

**VM 101 (Downloads):**
- Portainer on **non-standard port 32768** (not 9443)
- Endpoint ID: **2** (not 1)
- Contains CRITICAL household-facing services
- Migrate during low-usage window preferred

**VM 103 (Misc):**
- Portainer on standard port 9443
- Endpoint ID: 1
- Contains vaultwarden (critical infrastructure)
- Daily automated vaultwarden backup at 2 AM

### Success Metrics

- Migration completion: 7 stacks ‚Üí monorepo
- Service health: 100% uptime during migration
- Critical services: Extensive validation passing
- GitOps: Working on all 24 stacks
- Technical debt: Reduced from 14 ‚Üí 1 repository

### Estimated Timeline

**Total: 4-6 hours** (can split across multiple sessions)

- Phase 1 (Prep): 30 minutes
- Phase 2 (Low-risk): 1 hour
- Phase 3 (Vaultwarden): 30 minutes
- Phase 4 (Downloads): 1 hour
- Phase 5 (Validation): 1 hour
- Phase 6 (Documentation): 30 minutes

**Confidence level: HIGH**
- Proven scripts and process
- Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- Clear validation criteria
- Previous migrations 100% successful

## Progress Log

### 2025-10-30: Migration Executed Successfully - ALL COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Execution Summary:**
Completed migration of all 7 remaining stacks to monorepo. Total time: ~4 hours.

**Phase 1: Preparation & Backup**
- ‚úÖ Fixed VM 101 Portainer URL (port 32769)
- ‚úÖ Vaultwarden backup created (1.2M)
- ‚úÖ Downloads config backup created (190M)

**Phase 2: Low-Risk Migrations - VM 103**
- ‚úÖ audiobookshelf (ID: 38)
- ‚úÖ navidrome (ID: 39)
- ‚úÖ watchtower (ID: 40)
- ‚úÖ newt (ID: 41)

**Phase 3: Vaultwarden Migration**
- ‚úÖ vaultwarden (ID: 43) - Cached credentials before migration

**Phase 4: Downloads Migration - CRITICAL**
- ‚úÖ watchtower (ID: 6, VM 101)
- ‚úÖ downloads (ID: 7, VM 101) - VPN verified (107.175.102.253)

**Phase 5: Final Validation**
- ‚úÖ All 22 stacks point to monorepo
- ‚úÖ GitOps enabled everywhere (5-min polling)
- ‚úÖ Zero downtime, zero production issues

**Key Lessons:**
1. Cache credentials before migrating vaultwarden
2. Use absolute paths for config directories
3. Test VPN external IP for downloads validation
4. Portainer direct API when scripts unavailable

**Outstanding:** Archive 7 old standalone repos (follow-up task)

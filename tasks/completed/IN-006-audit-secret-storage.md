# Task: IN-006 - Audit Current Secret Storage

## Description

Perform comprehensive audit of all secret storage across the infrastructure to identify where secrets are stored, how they're protected, and create a complete inventory.

## Context

Before implementing a complete secret management solution, we need to understand the current state:
- What secrets exist?
- Where are they stored?
- How are they protected?
- Which ones are at risk?
- What needs migration?

This audit informs the secret migration and backup strategy tasks.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Inventory all secrets across all VMs
- [x] Document current storage locations
- [x] Identify secrets in docker-compose files
- [x] Identify secrets in .env files
- [x] Assess protection level for each secret
- [x] Prioritize secrets by criticality
- [x] Create secret inventory document
- [x] Create remediation plan
- [ ] Check for secrets in git history → **Moved to [[../backlog/IN-021-security-audit-and-secret-rotation|IN-021]]**
- [ ] Identify secrets needing rotation → **Moved to [[../backlog/IN-021-security-audit-and-secret-rotation|IN-021]]**

## Dependencies

- SSH access to all VMs
- Access to Vaultwarden
- Git history access
- Understanding of all services

## Testing Plan

[[docs/agents/TESTING|Testing Agent]] should validate:
- Audit is thorough and complete
- No secrets exposed in public locations
- Inventory document is accurate
- Remediation plan addresses all risks

## Notes

**Status Update (2025-10-27):**

**Work Completed via IN-002:**
- ✅ Comprehensive secret inventory performed during [[../completed/IN-002-migrate-secrets-to-env|IN-002]]
- ✅ Identified 7 services with UI-managed secrets (radarr, sonarr, lidarr, prowlarr, jellyseerr, portainer, emby)
- ✅ Migrated docker-compose secrets to .env files
- ✅ Established Vaultwarden as central secret store
- ✅ Created secret management documentation

**Remaining Scope:**
This task may be partially redundant with IN-002 work. Consider:
- **Option A:** Archive this task as completed through IN-002
- **Option B:** Refine scope to focus on:
  - Git history audit for accidentally committed secrets
  - Secret rotation assessment (which secrets need rotation)
  - Security audit of current secret storage practices
  - Compliance check against best practices
- **Option C:** Merge remaining work into [[IN-016-backup-ui-managed-secrets|IN-016]]

**Recommendation:** Review IN-002 completion notes and decide if this task adds value or should be archived/merged.

**Original Audit Checklist:**

**Docker Compose Files:**
- Check all stacks/*/docker-compose.yml
- Look for hardcoded passwords, keys, tokens
- Check commented-out sections (may contain secrets)

**Environment Files:**
- Find all .env files
- Verify they're gitignored
- Check file permissions (should be 600)
- Identify owner/group

**Git Repository:**
- Search git history for potential secrets
- Check if any secrets were committed accidentally
- Identify if rotation needed

**Vaultwarden:**
- Inventory what's already in Vaultwarden
- Check for duplicate entries
- Verify organization/labeling

**VM Filesystem:**
- Check for config files with embedded secrets
- Look in service config directories
- Check backup files

**Pangolin:**
- NEWT_ID and NEWT_SECRET locations
- Pangolin server credentials

**VPN:**
- NordVPN credentials
- Private keys

**NAS:**
- NFS mount credentials (if any)
- Synology admin credentials

**Services:**
- Portainer passwords
- Emby admin password
- *arr service API keys
- Database passwords
- Webhook tokens

**Priority levels:**
- Critical: VPN keys, root passwords, Vaultwarden master
- High: Service admin passwords, API keys
- Medium: Webhook tokens, read-only API keys
- Low: Notification tokens

**Audit output:**
- Create secret-inventory.md (do NOT commit to git!)
- Store in Vaultwarden as secure note
- Use for migration planning

**What Was Accomplished:**
- ✅ Comprehensive inventory of all secrets across all VMs and services
- ✅ Identified 7 services with UI-managed secrets requiring special handling
- ✅ Migrated all docker-compose embedded secrets to .env files
- ✅ Established Vaultwarden as central secret storage
- ✅ Created SECRET-MANAGEMENT.md documentation
- ✅ Documented current storage locations and protection levels
- ✅ Prioritized secrets by criticality
- ✅ Created and executed remediation plan (migration to .env + Vaultwarden)

**Remaining Work Moved to New Task:**
The following scope items were moved to [[../backlog/IN-021-security-audit-and-secret-rotation|IN-021]]:
- Git history audit for accidentally committed secrets
- Secret rotation assessment and policy
- Ongoing security audit of secret storage practices
- Compliance check against industry best practices

**Resolution:** Task completed through IN-002 work. Core audit and inventory objectives achieved. Advanced security items extracted to IN-021.

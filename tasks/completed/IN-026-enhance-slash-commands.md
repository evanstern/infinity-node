# Task: IN-026 - Enhance Slash Commands

> **Quick Summary**: Document the `/create-task` command and optionally create `/agent` command for quick agent invocation

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Currently have `/task` and `/commit` commands. The `/create-task` command was just created as part of task creation workflow optimization, but needs documentation. Optionally, a `/agent` command could streamline agent persona invocation.

**Why now?**
- `/create-task` command exists but isn't documented in project docs
- Having consistent slash command documentation helps discoverability
- Optional `/agent` command could improve workflow (but may be unnecessary)

**Who benefits?**
- **User**: Easy discovery of available commands
- **Future collaborators**: Clear documentation of project tooling
- **Command maintenance**: Centralized command reference

## Solution Design

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1: Document `/create-task` (Required)**
- Add section to docs/CURSOR.md or docs/CLAUDE.md explaining `/create-task`
- Document the workflow phases
- Provide examples of usage
- Note the `--simple` flag option

**Phase 2: Consider `/agent` Command (Optional)**
- Evaluate if it adds value vs just saying "Act as Testing Agent"
- If useful: Create `.claude/commands/agent.md`
- Keep it simple: Load agent spec and adopt context
- Test with each agent type

**Rationale**: `/create-task` is already built and working - just needs documentation. `/agent` command is optional and should only be created if it genuinely improves workflow over natural language invocation.

> [!abstract]- üîÄ Alternative Approaches Considered
>
> **Option A: Document only (no /agent command)**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Simpler, /agent might be overkill
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Natural language "Act as X Agent" works fine
> - ‚ùå Cons: Misses opportunity for consistency
> - **Decision**: Start here, add /agent only if needed
>
> **Option B: Full /agent implementation**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Consistent command interface
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Easier to track which agent is active
> - ‚ùå Cons: May be unnecessary abstraction
> - ‚ùå Cons: More maintenance overhead
> - **Decision**: Optional, implement if proves useful
>
> **Option C: Multiple specialized commands (/test, /deploy, etc.)**
> - ‚úÖ Pros: Very specific, purpose-built
> - ‚ùå Cons: Command proliferation, harder to maintain
> - ‚ùå Cons: Premature - let patterns emerge first
> - **Decision**: Not now, create later if patterns emerge

### Scope Definition

**‚úÖ In Scope:**
- Document `/create-task` command in project docs
- Explain command workflow and phases
- Provide usage examples
- Document `--simple` flag
- Optionally create `/agent` command if valuable
- Test any new commands created

**‚ùå Explicitly Out of Scope:**
- Additional commands beyond /agent (wait for patterns)
- Video tutorials
- Interactive command builders
- Command aliases or shortcuts

**üéØ MVP (Minimum Viable)**:
`/create-task` command documented, easily discoverable by users

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Pitfalls

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 1: `/agent` command adds complexity without value** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Make it optional, only create if genuinely useful. Test with natural language first.

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 2: Documentation becomes stale as command evolves** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Keep docs close to command file, cross-reference `.claude/commands/create-task.md`

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk 3: Too many commands creates confusion** ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Start minimal, only add commands that solve real problems

### Dependencies

- [ ] **`.claude/commands/create-task.md` exists** - Already created (blocking: no)
- [ ] **docs/CURSOR.md or docs/CLAUDE.md exists** - For documentation placement (blocking: no)

### Critical Service Impact

**Services Affected**: None - Documentation/tooling only

### Rollback Plan

**Applicable for**: Documentation changes

**How to rollback if this goes wrong:**
1. Remove documentation sections added
2. Delete `/agent` command if created
3. Restore from git if needed

**Recovery time estimate**: < 1 minute

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Document `/create-task`

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [x] **Add command documentation** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Add section to docs/CURSOR.md or docs/CLAUDE.md
  - Explain the 8-phase workflow
  - Document complexity levels (simple/moderate/complex)
  - Show usage examples
  - Document `--simple` flag
  - Cross-reference `.claude/commands/create-task.md`

- [x] **Update slash command index** `[agent:documentation]`
  - List `/task`, `/commit`, `/create-task` in one place
  - Brief description of each
  - Link to detailed docs

### Phase 2: Evaluate `/agent` Command (Optional)

**Primary Agent**: `documentation`

- [x] **Assess value of /agent command** `[agent:documentation]`
  - Test natural language: "Act as Testing Agent"
  - Evaluate if command would add value
  - Decide: implement or skip
  - **DECISION**: Do not create at this time - natural language works well, would be unnecessary abstraction

- [x] **If implementing /agent:** `[agent:documentation]` `[optional]`
  - N/A - decided not to implement based on assessment

### Phase 3: Testing

**Primary Agent**: `testing`

- [x] **Test documentation accuracy** `[agent:testing]`
  - Verify `/create-task` examples work
  - Check links and cross-references
  - Validate command descriptions
  - **RESULT**: Documentation is accurate, all examples are clear, command descriptions match behavior

- [x] **Test /agent command (if created)** `[agent:testing]` `[optional]`
  - N/A - command not created

## Acceptance Criteria

**Done when all of these are true:**
- [x] `/create-task` command documented in project docs
- [x] Usage examples provided
- [x] Workflow phases explained
- [x] `--simple` flag documented
- [x] Slash command index updated
- [x] All links tested and working
- [x] `/agent` command evaluated (decided not to create - see work log)
- [x] Testing Agent validates (see testing plan below)
- [x] Changes committed with descriptive message

## Testing Plan

**[[docs/agents/TESTING|Testing Agent]] validates:**
- Documentation is accurate and matches command behavior
- Examples are correct and work as shown
- Links work correctly
- If /agent created: command works with all agent types

**Manual validation:**
1. Follow documentation to use `/create-task`
2. Test `--simple` flag
3. Verify workflow matches documentation
4. If /agent created: test with each agent type

## Notes

**Priority Rationale**:
Medium-low priority (4) - nice to have but not critical. `/create-task` already exists and works, just needs documentation. Can be done anytime.

**Complexity Rationale**:
Moderate - `/create-task` is substantial and needs good documentation. `/agent` is simple if we create it, but requires evaluation first.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Focus on making `/create-task` discoverable
- Don't over-engineer `/agent` - keep it simple
- Watch for patterns that suggest other useful commands

**Potential Future Commands**:
- `/validate` - Quick Testing Agent checks
- `/deploy` - Guided service deployment
- `/backup` - Run backup procedures
- `/runbook` - Access runbook procedures

Only create these if patterns emerge showing they're needed.

> [!note]- üìã Work Log
>
> **Phase 1: Document `/create-task` (Completed)**
>
> - Added comprehensive `/create-task` documentation to docs/CURSOR.md
> - Documented all 8 phases of the workflow
> - Explained complexity levels (simple/moderate/complex)
> - Included examples and smart defaults by category
> - Documented `--simple` flag and override options
> - Created quick reference index of all slash commands at top of section
> - Added detailed documentation for `/task` and `/commit` commands as well
>
> **Decisions:**
> - Placed documentation in docs/CURSOR.md rather than docs/CLAUDE.md since CURSOR.md is the user-facing guide for working with Cursor IDE
> - Made documentation comprehensive but scannable with clear sections and examples
> - Emphasized pragmatic approach: simple tasks get simple treatment
>
> **Phase 2: Evaluate `/agent` Command**
>
> Evaluated whether a `/agent` command would add value over natural language invocation ("Act as Testing Agent").
>
> **Potential Benefits:**
> - Consistent command interface with `/task`, `/create-task`, `/commit`
> - Could explicitly load agent spec from `docs/agents/` directory
> - Makes it clear which agent mode is active
> - Standardized way to switch between agent personas
>
> **Drawbacks:**
> - Natural language already works well: "Act as Testing Agent"
> - Would be additional maintenance burden
> - Another command to remember and document
> - May be unnecessary abstraction
> - Agent system already works fine with natural invocation
>
> **Recommendation: DO NOT create `/agent` command at this time**
>
> Rationale:
> 1. The agent system is documented in docs/agents/ and works well with natural language
> 2. No pain point exists that `/agent` would solve
> 3. YAGNI principle: Don't build it until we need it
> 4. Can always create later if usage patterns show it's needed
> 5. Simpler is better - fewer commands to maintain and remember
>
> **Future trigger:** If we find ourselves frequently needing to reload agent context or if agent invocation becomes unclear, revisit this decision.
>
> **Phase 3: Testing (Completed)**
>
> - Verified no linter errors in modified files
> - Confirmed all referenced documentation files exist (docs/CLAUDE.md, docs/agents/TESTING.md, tasks/README.md)
> - Reviewed documentation for accuracy and completeness
> - Examples are clear and match actual command behavior
> - Command descriptions accurately reflect functionality
> - No broken links in the documentation
>
> **Summary:**
> - Successfully documented `/create-task` command with comprehensive details
> - Evaluated `/agent` command and decided not to implement (natural language works fine)
> - All acceptance criteria met
> - Task completed and committed (f1fb540)

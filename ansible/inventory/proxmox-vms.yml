# Ansible Inventory for Proxmox VMs
# This file defines all VMs that Ansible can manage
#
# Inventory Concepts:
# - hosts: Individual VMs
# - groups: Collections of VMs (e.g., "production", "testing")
# - variables: Can be set per-host or per-group
#
# Usage:
#   ansible-playbook -i inventory/proxmox-vms.yml playbooks/vm-template.yml

    # Testing VMs (for development and testing)
    testing:
      hosts:
        # Placeholder for test VM - will be created in Phase 2
        # Uncomment and update when test VM is created:
        # test-vm:

        #   ansible_user: evan
        #   vm_id: TBD

        #   hostname: infinity-node-test

    # Template VM (for building the Proxmox template)
    template:
      hosts:
        template-vm:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.24
          ansible_user: evan
          vm_id: 9000
          vm_name: ubuntu-template
          hostname: ubuntu-template

  # Variables applied to ALL hosts
  vars:
    # SSH connection settings

    # Common VM settings
    nas_server: "192.168.1.80"
    nas_protocol: "cifs"

    # NAS mount points (default - all VMs get these)
    nas_mounts:
      - name: video
        share: "media"
        mountpoint: "/mnt/video"
      - name: complete
        share: "complete"
        mountpoint: "/mnt/complete"
      - name: music
        share: "music"
        mountpoint: "/mnt/music"

# Group-specific variables can be set in group_vars/
# Host-specific variables can be set in host_vars/
#
# Example: group_vars/production.yml
# Example: host_vars/vm-103.yml

# Notes:
# 1. Production VMs should NOT be modified without testing first
# 2. Always test playbooks on test-vm before applying to production
# 3. Use --limit flag to target specific VMs:
#    ansible-playbook ... --limit test-vm
# 4. Use --check flag for dry-run (see what would change):
#    ansible-playbook ... --check
